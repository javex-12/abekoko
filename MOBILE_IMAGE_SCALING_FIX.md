# 📱 Mobile Image Scaling Fix - Salem Church

## 🚨 **Issue Fixed: Text Going Out of Borders When Tapping Images**

### **Problem Description:**
- When users tap/touch leader images on mobile devices
- Images would scale up (grow bigger/bolder) 
- Text badges like "Pastor's Warden" would be pushed outside card borders
- Only the vicar image stayed within borders (due to different styling)

### **Root Cause:**
- CSS hover effects were being triggered by touch events
- `.leader-card:hover .leader-image { transform: scale(1.08) rotate(2deg); }`
- This scaling pushed content outside the card boundaries
- Mobile browsers treat touch as hover, causing unwanted scaling

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Created Mobile Touch Fixes CSS**
- **File:** `mobile-touch-fixes.css`
- **Purpose:** Override hover effects specifically for mobile devices
- **Approach:** Disable all scaling animations on touch devices

### **2. Mobile-Specific CSS Rules:**
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    /* Disable ALL hover/tap scaling effects */
    .leader-card:hover,
    .leader-card:active,
    .leader-card:focus {
        transform: none !important;
        box-shadow: var(--shadow) !important;
    }
    
    /* Prevent image scaling when tapped */
    .leader-card:hover .leader-image {
        transform: none !important;
        border-color: var(--primary-color) !important;
        filter: none !important;
    }
    
    /* Keep badges within bounds */
    .leader-card [style*="position: absolute"] {
        max-width: 80% !important;
        white-space: nowrap !important;
        overflow: hidden !important;
        text-overflow: ellipsis !important;
    }
}
```

### **3. Touch Device Detection:**
```css
@media (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse) {
    /* Targets touch devices specifically */
    .leader-card:hover {
        transform: none !important;
    }
}
```
