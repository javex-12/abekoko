# 🔗 Connect CMS Content to Website

## 📋 **What's Happening Now**

### **✅ CMS Working:**
- You can edit content in the admin dashboard
- Content is saved to `content/` folders
- Files are created in Markdown format

### **❌ Website Not Updated:**
- Website still shows hardcoded content
- Need to connect CMS content to website display
- Requires JavaScript to load dynamic content

---

## 🎯 **CURRENT SITUATION**

### **When you edit in CMS:**
1. **Content saved** to files like:
   - `content/service/2025-01-13-service.md`
   - `content/announcements/2025-01-13-news.md`
   - `content/prayer/2025-week-3.md`

2. **Website still shows**:
   - Hardcoded HTML content
   - Static text in `index_updated.html`
   - No connection to CMS files

### **What we need:**
- **JavaScript code** to load CMS content
- **Replace static content** with dynamic content
- **Connect each section** to its CMS collection

---

## 🚀 **SOLUTION OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Simple JavaScript Integration (Recommended)**
- Add JavaScript to load content from CMS files
- Keep current beautiful design
- Dynamic content updates

### **Option 2: Static Site Generator**
- Use Jekyll, Hugo, or 11ty
- Builds static pages from CMS content
- More complex setup

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Keep some content static
- Make key sections dynamic
- Gradual implementation

## 🔧 **WHAT I CAN IMPLEMENT**

### **Dynamic Sections I Can Add:**

#### **📅 Service Information**
- Load current Sunday service from CMS
- Replace hardcoded service details
- Auto-update when staff changes it

#### **📢 Announcements**
- Load announcements from CMS
- Display by category and priority
- Auto-expire old announcements

#### **🙏 Prayer Points**
- Load weekly prayer points
- Display current week's prayers
- Auto-update "Food for Thought"

#### **📅 Events**
- Load upcoming events
- Display event flyers
- Show event details

#### **📸 Gallery**
- Load photo albums from CMS
- Display recent church photos
- Organize by event type

## 📋 **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Core Content (Essential)**
1. **Service Information** - Sunday service details
2. **Announcements** - Church news and updates
3. **Prayer Points** - Weekly prayers

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Content**
4. **Events** - Special church events
5. **Gallery** - Photo albums

### **Phase 3: Settings**
6. **Contact Info** - Church details
7. **Leadership** - Pastor and staff info

---

## 🎯 **TECHNICAL APPROACH**

### **How it will work:**

1. **JavaScript functions** to fetch content files
2. **Parse Markdown** content and metadata
3. **Update HTML sections** with CMS content
4. **Fallback to static** if CMS content unavailable

### **Example for Service Information:**
```javascript
// Load current service from CMS
async function loadServiceInfo() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/content/service/latest.md');
    const content = await response.text();
    const serviceData = parseMarkdown(content);
    updateServiceDisplay(serviceData);
  } catch (error) {
    // Keep static content as fallback
    console.log('Using static service info');
  }
}
```

## 🔍 **CHECKING CMS CONTENT**

### **To see what you created:**

1. **Check GitHub repository**:
   - Look in `content/` folders
   - See the Markdown files created
   - Verify content is saved

2. **File locations**:
   - Service: `content/service/`
   - Announcements: `content/announcements/`
   - Prayer: `content/prayer/`

## 🎉 **NEXT DECISION**

**Would you like me to:**

1. **Implement dynamic content loading** for key sections?
2. **Start with Service Information** only?
3. **Show you the CMS files** that were created first?
4. **Create a test page** to demonstrate dynamic content?

**The CMS is working perfectly - we just need to connect it to display the content on your website!** 🔗
