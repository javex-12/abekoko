# 🔧 Git Sync Solution - Salem Church Website

## 🚨 **Issue:** Remote repository has changes you don't have locally

This is a common Git situation. Here's how to resolve it safely:

---

## 🎯 **Solution Options (Choose One)**

### **Option 1: Safe Merge (Recommended)**
This preserves both your local changes and remote changes:

```bash
# 1. Fetch the latest changes from remote
git fetch origin

# 2. Pull and merge (this will create a merge commit)
git pull origin main

# 3. If there are conflicts, Git will tell you which files
# 4. After resolving any conflicts, push your changes
git push origin main
```

### **Option 2: Rebase (Clean History)**
This replays your changes on top of the remote changes:

```bash
# 1. Fetch the latest changes
git fetch origin

# 2. Rebase your changes on top of remote
git rebase origin/main

# 3. If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue
git rebase --continue

# 4. Push your changes
git push origin main
```

### **Option 3: Force Push (Use with Caution)**
⚠️ **Only use if you're sure the remote changes aren't important:**

```bash
# This will overwrite remote with your local changes
git push origin main --force
```

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Steps for Salem Church**

### **Step 1: Check What's Different**
```bash
# See what commits are on remote that you don't have
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline

# See what commits are on remote that you don't have
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline
```

### **Step 2: Safe Pull and Merge**
```bash
# Pull the remote changes and merge
git pull origin main
```

### **Step 3: Handle Any Conflicts**
If there are conflicts, Git will show you which files. Edit them to resolve conflicts, then:
```bash
# After resolving conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

### **Step 4: Push Your Complete Work**
```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## 🔍 **What Likely Happened**

1. **Remote repository** has some commits (maybe from GitHub web interface)
2. **Your local repository** has your organized website changes
3. **Git won't let you push** because histories have diverged

---

## 📋 **Quick Commands to Run Now**

```bash
# 1. See what's different
git fetch origin
git log --oneline --graph --all

# 2. Pull and merge safely
git pull origin main

# 3. Push your changes
git push origin main
```

## 🚨 **If You Get Merge Conflicts**

### **Common Conflict Files:**
- `README.md` - Often edited on GitHub
- `index.html` - If edited remotely
- Any files modified both locally and remotely

### **Resolving Conflicts:**
1. **Open the conflicted file** in your editor
2. **Look for conflict markers:**
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Your local changes
   =======
   Remote changes
   >>>>>>> origin/main
   ```
3. **Choose which version to keep** or combine both
4. **Remove the conflict markers**
5. **Save the file**
6. **Add and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add filename
   git commit -m "Resolve conflict in filename"
   ```
