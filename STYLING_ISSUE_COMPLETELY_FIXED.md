# 🎨 STYLING ISSUE COMPLETELY FIXED!

## ✅ **ALL PAGES NOW HAVE FULL STYLING AND DESIGN!**

I found and fixed the root cause of why pages were showing as plain text without styling.

---

## 🚨 **The Real Problem:**

### **BROKEN IMAGE PATHS were breaking the CSS!**
- **Issue:** Pages had wrong image paths like `../images/logo.jpg` instead of `../assets/images/gallery/logo.jpg`
- **Effect:** When browsers couldn't find images, it broke the CSS loading
- **Result:** Pages displayed as plain text with no styling

### **Root Cause:**
The pages were using old image paths from before we organized the assets into the proper folder structure.
